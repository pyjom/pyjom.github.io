In this scenario, I have recently been hired as a Data Engineer by a New York-based coffee shop chain looking to expand nationally by opening several franchise locations. They want to streamline operations and revamp their data infrastructure as part of their expansion process.

My job is to design their relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and make it easier for their executives to make data-driven decisions.

## Objectives:
1. Design a central database to house all of the data since it resides in several systems.
2. Create a database objects and load them with source data.
3. Load the data into databases using several RDBMS
