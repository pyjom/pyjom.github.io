## Answering using ANOVA
Importance:
- This analysis uses ANOVA to compare the means of the groups. Think of it this way, an analyst wants to find the impact of different trading strategy in stock market on the average annual return of the portfolios of their clients. Here, the main question would be, does different trading strategy significantly impact the annual return of the portfolios? ANOVA cater this question. However, by answering this question, we can infer a lot of new informations and new questions will also asise, like, what is the best trading strategy, what is the effect if this strategy is used in cryptocurrency market or fiat martket? 

Objective:
1. To determine the significant differences of the independent variables to the dependent variables

Tech Used
1. Python 
    - used in integration of different files to a single database
    - used in data manipulation and data transformation
2. JASP
    - used for easy descriptive analysis
    - used to run Kruskal Wallis Test


### Python script
- Here I used Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to practice my OOP skills because I am not that good with it. Based on what I study, OOP is generally used to make the lines of code lesser and more readable by creating classes and objects.

```python
import pandas as pd
class Merger:
    def __init__(self, files):
        self.files =files
        
    def iterate(self):
        combined = pd.DataFrame()
        for file in self.files: # Iterating through the files
            print('i')
            excel = pd.ExcelFile(file) # Opening each file
            for sheet in excel.sheet_names: # Opening each sheets of the file
                df = excel.parse(sheet)
                first = df.shape
                df = df.dropna(thresh=5) 
                second = df.shape 
                if first == second:
                    print(second)
                else:
                    print(first, '-->', second)               
                
                combined = pd.concat([combined, df])
        comb_1 = combined.drop_duplicates()
        print('Total index of the table is', comb_1.shape)
        return(comb_1)
    
    def save(self, combined_data, output_file):
        combined_data.to_excel(output_file, index=False)
        return('File is saved')

files = ['Barangka.xlsx', 'Nangka.xlsx', 'Parang.xlsx']
merger = Merger(files)
comb_data =merger.iterate()
merger.save(comb_data, 'combined_data(1).xlsx')
;
```
